what happens at every iteration?
- get an x of k length
- create v
	v has same amount of non-zero entries as x
	v is a vector of original A which includes diag and entry below
		- will this always be the case? YES
- create v*v'
	 what do the entries in this matrix look like?
	columns that share entries with with column k get their entries modified

----------
every iteration
get a smaller column
apply a transformation to all columns
- this transformation makes all values besides the first element of the subcolumn zero
what happens to the other columns?
- this transformation matrix v*v' only has four entries in its four top right elements
- the next two columns share elements with the first column; so they are affected by the transformation
- so the subdiagonal below the diagonal gets zeroed out and "shifted" to another upper subdiagonal
- columns that don't share row elements remain the same
- end result is a p = 0, q = 2 diagonal matrix

what is Q?
v is a vector with two non-zero entries, then the matrix formed by v*v'contains only four non-zero entries; a11,a12,a21,a22.then Qi at the i-th iteration is an identity matrix with four potentially non-zero entries, aii, aii+1, ai+1i,ai+1i+1. so the cumulative Q is an upperhessenberg matrix.
----------
[q4b] RQ is upper hessenberg - Q is upperhessenberg, r is a q-2 matrix, so result is a upperhessenberg (assuming no cancellation - prove?). 

R: upper triangular matrix, a tridiagonal matrix shifted up
Q:
