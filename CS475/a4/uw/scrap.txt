interpreting the image matrix U

W = weight matrix of a graph, i.e. weight on edges for every node i
D = degree matrix of a graph, i.e. sum of all the weights on all edges


look at adjacent pixels (i.e. on matrix U). then the "laplacian" matrix we're creating, ones directly beside it have wij left and right. above and diagonal are then m*n away
- make sample matrix and see what above/below/diagonal difference will be



what row is element (2,3) in? m = 6, n = 6
- 9
!!!!!!   	(i-1)*m+j	!!!!!!!!
- (2-1)*6+3 = 1*6+3=9

element(1,2)
(1-1)*6+1 = 1

element(6,5)


%dumb way = flatten, get index number?
