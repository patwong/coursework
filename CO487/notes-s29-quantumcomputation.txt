s4: how to read |i> ?
- how does it require one operation?

ex: why is finding order of x equivalent to factoring N?
q: why is floor(N/r)*r = phi(N)?

sqrt(86) - where this from? 512/6 ~= 86


A:
|i> => all possibilities for i, usually 0 or 1 (qubit)
r | phi(n) because of FLT - see notes
512/6 ~= 86
