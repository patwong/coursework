[CO487 - S30 - Quantum Key distribution]
uncertainty principle: no way to determine a quantum state without measuring it
quantum superposition: prior to measurement, all possible states of an object exist simultaneously (schroedinger's cat)
quantum entanglement: in an entangled pair, measuring one object constrains the possible states for the other object
	(unmeasured object's state must be consistent with the first object's measurement)
.
[quantum key distribution]
QKD achieves unbreakable symmetric-key encryption using quantum mechanics to simulate a one0-time pad
- QKD requires the ability to transmit quantum states
- an acual one-time pad is not required
- no secret information needs be transferred
- any eavesdropping can be detected - because eavesdropping = measurement

[BB84]
polarized light

**
sending/measuring basis: horizontal, vertical, diagonal filters
- goes through horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
	e.g. if horizontal filter: all horizontal light goes through, half diagonal, no vertical
result: shared public key

A: 4 choices of photon polarization - send one photon at a time
B: doesn't know polarization of photon
- there are four choices, filter can only be in one position


[security of BB84]
- eavesdropping of photons will alter polarization, which detectable
- the most conservative strategy is to shut down communications if eavesdropping detected
	- maximizes security, availability
- alternatively, if only some bits intercepted, can apply techniques of information reconciliation and privacy amplification
	information reconciliation: use error-correcting codes to fix errors (caused by eavesdropping or otherwise)
	privacy amplification: hash the shared key to eliminate any partial knowledge of the key that an adversary may have (universal hash function)
