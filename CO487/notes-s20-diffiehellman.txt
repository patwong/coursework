[CO 487 - S20 - Diffie-Hellman key exchange]
Order: the smallest t for an element x in Z*_n s.t. x^t = 1 in Z*_n

example: order of 3 in Z*_17 is 16 - it is a generator
- order of 2 is 8

Q: for DH notation, how large is large for g?

[key exchange]
Alice and Bob - both know the 'n' of Z?
=> assuming i mean p of Z*_p

[square and multiply algorithm]
calculating x mod p is quick, calculating x = m^e is slow if done naively

[Diffie-Hellman assumption]
given g, g^a, g^b, computationally infeasible to determine g^ab

[Discrete logarithm assumption]
theorem: for all values of p, two assumptions are equivalent
1. DH assumption
- as above
2. DLOG assumption
- given g, g^a, computationally infeasible to determine a

[generalized diffie-hellman]
can generalize DH to any number system closed under multiplication
- let p be a prime
- let f(x) be an irreducible polynomial with coefficients in Zp
	- an irreducible polynomial is a polynomial which has no factors other than 1 and itself
- the set of polynomials with coefficients in Zp mod f(x) is closed under multiplication

defn: we denote GF(q) the finite field of size q, if it exists
- GF(p) = Zp
- GF(p^d) = {g(x) in Zp[x]: deg(g) < d}
- arithmetic in GF(p^d) is performed mod f(x) (deg(f) = d)

*notes about field
- random elements in the GF(2^128) w/ modulus f(x) => any polynomial with degree < 128
- numbers are elements of the field, i.e. a polynomial of degree 0
coefficients 
- in this field, polynomial of deg 0 can only be 0 or 1, because GF(2), i.e. coefficient is 0 or 1, so number can only be 0 or 1
