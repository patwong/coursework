[CO 487 - S05 - DES]
feistel network
ptext divided into two halves
block cipher

f: function that takes ki and mi as input, outputs some value

key scheduling
- PC1, PC2 take 64 bit input, output 56 bits

component function
m gets sent to an expansion table, XOR'd with k
every 6 bits of above result goes to s-box, s1 to s8
- outputs 4 bits

s-boxes are only components of DES that are non-linear
- security of DES crucially depend on choice
