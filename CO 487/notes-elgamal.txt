[CO 487 - 23 - Elgamal]
Elgamal encryption
public: prime p, g integer in Zp*
key generation: random x in Z, 1 <= x <= p - 1
	kpub = g^x mod p	kpriv = x

encryption: m in Zp*
- random r in Z, 0 <= r <= p - 1
E(m) = (g^r, m*(g^x)^r) mod p

decryption: (c1, c2) in Zp*^2 <==== what is Zp*2?
D(c1,c2) = c2*(c1^-1)^x mod p

to receiver:
- r is not known or unknown
- x is unknown

why is forward direction proof trivial?
