[CO 487 - exam study - questions + thoughts]
[S10 - block modes of encryption]
CFB reusing IV - different than CBC?
OFB: reusing IV under same key invalidates semantic security
- can totally break
- e.g. c1 XOR p1 = k1
- under OFB with same IV and key, c2 XOR p2 = k1

[S14 - MACs]
no non-repudiation or confidentiality in MACs
- why? because shared secret. anyone who has shared secret can compute MAC

[S16 - Applied Cryptanalysis]
poodle attack - ????

[S25 - elliptic curve]
questions in the file


[S30 - Quantum Key Distribution]
S5: in notes, say four choices of photon polarization - but we only have 3 different polarizations? (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)

[S31 - hardware implementation]
polynomial+normal basis squaring
- squaring the coefficient leads to only the original coefficient? e.g. a^2 = 
=> solved in notes

what is the matrix in normal basis?
