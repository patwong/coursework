[CO 487 - S21 - Security Definitions for public-key encryption]
randomized algorithm G: {1^l: l in N} -> Kpub x Kpriv
- what is it?

security of RSA
- if RSA is totally insecure, then integer factorization is easy
	- how?

[defn of pkc]
pkc consists of
- M: message space
- C: ciphertext space
- Kpub: space of public keys
- Kpriv: space of private keys
- G: {1^l: l in N} -> Kpriv x Kpub : a randomized algorithm - key-generation function
- encryption algorithm E: kpub x M -> c
- decryption algorithm D: kpriv x M -> M

correctness requirement
- given key pair produced by G, D(kpriv,E(kpub,m)) = m, for all m in M

[framework for security defns]
security depends on three questions
1. how does adversary interact with communicating parties?
2. what is computational power of adversary?
3. adversary's goal?

basic assumption: adversary knows everything about algorithm except secret key k
