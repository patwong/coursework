why does line through P and Q touch point -(P+Q)
same with P and -(P+P)?
P+Q is on E, but P and Q individually or not? aren't p and q points?

[point addition formulae]
xp+q?
yp+q?

**points being added repeatedly - e.g. xP means point P added x times
pick a curve E and an element p
pick x in Z at random
send xP in E to bob
bob picks y in Z at random
bob sends yp in E to alice

alice and bob can compute xyP = x(yP) = y(xP) in E
